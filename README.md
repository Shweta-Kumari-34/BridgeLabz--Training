## Day 1 – Generics Introduction and Problem Solving  
**(Date: 09-Jan-2026)**

### 📌 What I Worked On
- Learned Java Generics for type-safe and reusable collection handling
- Understood type parameters (`T`, `E`, `K`, `V`) and their usage in APIs
- Implemented generic classes and generic methods
- Used bounded types (`extends`, `super`) and wildcards (`?`, `? extends`, `? super`)
- Followed generics best practices (avoiding raw types, safe bounds)
- Solved practice problems using generics
- Created the `java-collection-practice` repository
- Committed and pushed all solutions to the repository

## Day 23 – Java Collections Framework (List, Set, Queue & Map)  
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)**

### 📌 What I Worked On
- Studied Java Collections Framework architecture and hierarchy
- Understood the role of `Collection` and `Map` interfaces
- Learned List interface and implementations:
  - `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Vector`
- Performed common List operations (add, remove, update, search)
- Practiced iteration using for-each, `Iterator`, and `ListIterator`
- Learned Set interface and implementations:
  - `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `TreeSet`
- Understood uniqueness, ordering, and sorting behavior in Sets
- Learned Map interface and implementations:
  - `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `TreeMap`
- Performed key-value operations and iteration using `entrySet()`, `keySet()`, and `values()`
- Learned Queue interface and implementations:
  - `PriorityQueue`, `ArrayDeque`
- Practiced queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, peek, poll)
- Understood FIFO and priority-based processing
- Explored internal working, use cases, and performance aspects
- Solved real-time examples and committed all work
