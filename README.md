## Day 1 – Lambda Expressions, Method References & Interfaces 
**(Date: 27-Jan-2026)**

### 📌 What I Worked On
- Studied Java 8 goals and functional programming concepts
- Learned lambda expression syntax and target typing
- Implemented custom and predefined functional interfaces (`Predicate`, `Function`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`)
- Practiced method references **(static, instance, constructor)**
- Applied Java 8 best practices
- Solved practice problems and committed all work

## Day 2 – Lambda Expressions, Method References & Interfaces 
**(Date: 28-Jan-2026)**

### 📌 What I Worked On
(Date: 28-Jan-2026)
- Mastered **Java Stream API** core concepts and the mechanics of **Lazy Evaluation**
- Practiced diverse stream initialization using Collections, Arrays, and Static Generators
- Leveraged **Intermediate Operations** to transform data:
    * `filter`, `map`, `flatMap`, `sorted`, `distinct`, `limit`
- Utilized **Terminal Operations** to produce results:
    * `collect`, `forEach`, `reduce`, `count`, `findFirst`
- Explored advanced data aggregation with **Collectors**:
    * `toList`, `toSet`, `joining`, `groupingBy`, `partitioningBy`, `summarizingInt`
- Evaluated **Parallel Streams** for multi-threaded processing and performance optimization
- Developed a **Functional Programming Mini-Project**:
    * Managed appointment data through custom filtering, grouping, and multi-level sorting
- Solved comprehensive practice challenges and committed all workshop materials
