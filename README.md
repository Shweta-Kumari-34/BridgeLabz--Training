## Day 1 – Design Patterns & SOLID Principles
**(Date: 31-Jan-2026)**
## 📌 What I Worked On — Design Patterns & SOLID Principles

- **Mastered SOLID Design Principles:**
    - **SRP**: Single Responsibility Principle for focused class design
    - **OCP**: Open/Closed Principle (Open for extension, closed for modification)
    - **LSP**: Liskov Substitution Principle for robust inheritance
    - **ISP**: Interface Segregation to avoid "fat" interfaces
    - **DIP**: Dependency Inversion for decoupled architecture
- **Core Design Philosophies:**
    - Practiced **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself), **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and **YAGNI**
    - Focused on **Separation of Concerns** and **Programming to Interfaces**
    - Adopted the "Favor **Composition over Inheritance**" mindset
- **Applied Object Calisthenics for Clean Code:**
    - Enforced **One level of indentation** per method
    - Followed the **"One dot per line"** rule (Law of Demeter)
    - Engineered small, highly cohesive classes for better maintainability
- **Implemented GoF (Gang of Four) Design Patterns:**
    - **Creational**: Singleton, Factory, Builder
    - **Behavioral**: Observer
    - Analyzed patterns using **UML Diagrams** and real-world analogies
- **Practical Application:**
    - Solved pattern-based architectural exercises and mini-design problems
