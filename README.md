- Read CSV files using:
  - `BufferedReader` (manual parsing)
  - OpenCSV (`CSVReader`)
- Wrote CSV data using:
  - `BufferedWriter`
  - OpenCSV (`CSVWriter`)
- Parsed records using `String.split()` and mapped data with `CsvToBean`
- Applied numeric and regex-based data validation
- Performed filtering, searching, updating, sorting, and merging of CSV data
- Handled large CSV files efficiently using chunk-based processing
- Generated reports and exported structured CSV output
- Solved practice problems and committed all work
