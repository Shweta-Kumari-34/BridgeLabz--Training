### Week 7: Java Design Principles & Design Patterns

---
## Day 1 – Design Patterns & SOLID Principles
**(Date: 31-Jan-2026)**
## 📌 What I Worked On — Design Patterns & SOLID Principles

- **Mastered SOLID Design Principles:**
    - **SRP**: Single Responsibility Principle for focused class design
    - **OCP**: Open/Closed Principle (Open for extension, closed for modification)
    - **LSP**: Liskov Substitution Principle for robust inheritance
    - **ISP**: Interface Segregation to avoid "fat" interfaces
    - **DIP**: Dependency Inversion for decoupled architecture
- **Core Design Philosophies:**
    - Practiced **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself), **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and **YAGNI**
    - Focused on **Separation of Concerns** and **Programming to Interfaces**
    - Adopted the "Favor **Composition over Inheritance**" mindset
- **Applied Object Calisthenics for Clean Code:**
    - Enforced **One level of indentation** per method
    - Followed the **"One dot per line"** rule (Law of Demeter)
    - Engineered small, highly cohesive classes for better maintainability
- **Implemented GoF (Gang of Four) Design Patterns:**
    - **Creational**: Singleton, Factory, Builder
    - **Behavioral**: Observer
    - Analyzed patterns using **UML Diagrams** and real-world analogies
- **Practical Application:**
    - Solved pattern-based architectural exercises and mini-design problems

### Week 8: Java Design Principles & Design Patterns

## Day 1 – Multithreading in Java
**(Date: 02-Feb-2026)**

## 📌 What I Worked On — 
- **Core Concepts & Architecture:**
    - Analyzed **Process vs. Thread** execution models.
    - Evaluated the benefits and potential pitfalls (Race Conditions, Deadlocks) of Multithreading.
- **Thread Management:**
    - Mastered the **Java Thread Lifecycle**: `NEW`, `RUNNABLE`, `BLOCKED`, `WAITING`, `TIMED_WAITING`, and `TERMINATED`.
    - Implemented thread creation via **Extending `Thread`** and **Implementing `Runnable`**.
    - Controlled execution using core methods: `start()`, `sleep()`, `join()`, `yield()`, and `isAlive()`.
- **Advanced Threading:**
    - Configured **Thread Priorities** and **Daemon Threads**.
    - Managed interruption handling for graceful thread termination.
- **Concurrency & Data Integrity:**
    - Implemented **Synchronization** blocks to protect shared database resources.
    - Conducted performance benchmarking: **Single-threaded vs. Multi-threaded** payroll insertion.
- **Practical Use Cases & Testing:**
    - Engineered parallel employee insertion and salary update modules.
    - Verified database consistency and thread-safety using **JUnit**.
    - Logged execution metrics to validate performance gains.
