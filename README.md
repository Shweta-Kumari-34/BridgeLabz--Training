## Day 1 – Generics Introduction and Problem Solving  
**(Date: 09-Jan-2026)**

### 📌 What I Worked On
- Learned Java Generics for type-safe and reusable collection handling
- Understood type parameters (`T`, `E`, `K`, `V`) and their usage in APIs
- Implemented generic classes and generic methods
- Used bounded types (`extends`, `super`) and wildcards (`?`, `? extends`, `? super`)
- Followed generics best practices (avoiding raw types, safe bounds)
- Solved practice problems using generics
- Created the `java-collection-practice` repository
- Committed and pushed all solutions to the repository
