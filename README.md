## Day 1 – Generics Introduction and Problem Solving  
**(Date: 09-Jan-2026)**

### 📌 What I Worked On
- Learned Java Generics for type-safe and reusable collection handling
- Understood type parameters (`T`, `E`, `K`, `V`) and their usage in APIs
- Implemented generic classes and generic methods
- Used bounded types (`extends`, `super`) and wildcards (`?`, `? extends`, `? super`)
- Followed generics best practices (avoiding raw types, safe bounds)
- Solved practice problems using generics
- Created the `java-collection-practice` repository
- Committed and pushed all solutions to the repository

### Week 5: Java Collections Framework & Problem Solving
---
## Day 2 – Java Collections Framework (List, Set, Queue & Map)  
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)**

### 📌 What I Worked On
- Studied Java Collections Framework architecture and hierarchy
- Understood the role of `Collection` and `Map` interfaces
- Learned List interface and implementations:
  - `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `Vector`
- Performed common List operations (add, remove, update, search)
- Practiced iteration using for-each, `Iterator`, and `ListIterator`
- Learned Set interface and implementations:
  - `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `TreeSet`
- Understood uniqueness, ordering, and sorting behavior in Sets
- Learned Map interface and implementations:
  - `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `TreeMap`
- Performed key-value operations and iteration using `entrySet()`, `keySet()`, and `values()`
- Learned Queue interface and implementations:
  - `PriorityQueue`, `ArrayDeque`
- Practiced queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, peek, poll)
- Understood FIFO and priority-based processing
- Explored internal working, use cases, and performance aspects
- Solved real-time examples and committed all work

## Day 3– Java I/O Streams  
**(Date: 19-Jan-2026)**

### 📌 What I Worked On
- Studied Java I/O Streams architecture and stream-based data handling
- Learned byte streams and character streams for file operations
- Implemented file streams:
  - `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`
  - `FileReader`, `FileWriter`
- Used buffered streams for efficient I/O:
  - `BufferedInputStream`, `BufferedOutputStream`
  - `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`
- Worked with object streams:
  - `ObjectInputStream`, `ObjectOutputStream`
  - Serialization and deserialization
- Practiced in-memory streams:
  - `ByteArrayInputStream`, `ByteArrayOutputStream`
- Used bridge streams:
  - `InputStreamReader`, `OutputStreamWriter`
- Applied try-with-resources, buffering, and performance best practices
- Solved practical problems (file copy, serialization, large-file handling)
- Committed and pushed all work

## Day 4 – Exception Handling  
**(Date: 20-Jan-2026)**

### 📌 What I Worked On
- Studied Java exception handling concepts and exception hierarchy
- Differentiated between checked and unchecked exceptions
- Implemented `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and multiple catch blocks
- Practiced handling common runtime exceptions
- Used nested try-catch for granular error handling
- Applied `throw` and `throws` for exception creation and propagation
- Designed and implemented custom exceptions for business rules
- Used try-with-resources for automatic resource management
- Solved scenario-based exception handling problems
- Committed and pushed all work
